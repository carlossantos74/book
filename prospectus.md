#### Brief Description:

This is a proposal for a book on *elementary computer science* for broad audiences with a background at the level of upper secondary school or above. The idea is to explain the absolute basics of computer science with a strong focus on *intuition* rather than formalism. The book explains, similar to related books, how a computer works in principle and how to do some basic programming, but goes beyond that by exploring the general *nature* of information and computing in the context of today's reality of ubiquitous use of digital devices. This is also different from teaching computational thinking with its focus on problem solving.

Similar to elementary arithmetic with its five categories (numbers, measurement, geometry, algebra, and probabilities), we present five categories of elementary computer science in five chapters called information, machine, programming, tools, and computing. Information is on encoding and decoding information in bits. Machine is on a simple yet representative and still realistic machine model. Programming is on fundamental programming language concepts and basic algorithms. Tools is on translation and interpretation of programs with a focus on the semantics of programs. Computing is on virtualizing computation for enabling computing as utility and cloud computing. However, unlike traditional textbooks on elementary arithmetic, we use simple examples rather than formulae whenever possible.

A common theme of our book is an important concept in computer science called self-referentiality which has immediate counterparts in the real world. Think of an English dictionary written in English. The same can be done with software that defines its own meaning or constructs a virtual machine for running software everywhere including itself. Seeing what self-referentiality is and how it is resolved is key to gaining an integrated understanding of elementary computer science. Teaching self-referentiality in its various forms is inspired by a software system called selfie that we developed over many years teaching undergraduate computer science students. Selfie is the source of most examples we use in the book and enables us to integrate our five categories of elementary computer science in one system. Due to its technical nature we nevertheless do not explain selfie in detail.

Selfie is open source and available online at [selfie.cs.uni-salzburg.at](http://selfie.cs.uni-salzburg.at)

For an introduction to selfie and a work-in-progress attempt of the author to develop a curriculum of elementary computer science see the paper "[Selfie and the Basics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133850.3133857)" by the author which appeared in the proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on New Ideas, New Paradigms, and Reflections on Programming and Software (Onward!) in 2017.

#### Outstanding Features

The *focus* of the book is on elementary computer science as a whole, not just computers or programming or problem solving and so on, targeting readers with diverse backgrounds other than computer science but in need of gaining an intuitive understanding of computer science in general. We present basic principles that are simple individually and then show how to combine them towards the full capabilities of modern computing.

The *theme* of the book is the integration of basic principles of computer science through self-referentiality in its various forms. Rather than avoiding an admittedly challenging concept, we developed with the selfie system a solid foundation for resolving the inherent self-referentiality in computing and leverage that to explain how meaning is created on a mindless machine.

The *language* of the book is casual with a focus on intuition rather than formalism, even using humor, which is unusual in a technical field such as computer science and an attempt to create an emotional bond between author and reader. In the experience of the author, teaching students majoring in fields other than computer science, emotion is particularly important to reduce the infamous pain in learning about computer science. The language of the book is in fact a personal statement of the author and deliberately kept that way to transport the author's passion about computer science.

#### The Author

Christoph Kirsch is Professor at the Department of Computer Sciences of the University of Salzburg, Austria. He received his Dr.Ing. degree from Saarland University in 1999 while at the Max Planck Institute for Computer Science in Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany. From 1999 to 2004 he worked as Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of the University of California, Berkeley. He later returned to Berkeley as Visiting Scholar (2008-2013) and Visiting Professor (2014) at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. His research interests are in concurrent programming, memory management, virtualization, and formal verification. Dr. Kirsch co-invented embedded programming languages and systems such as Giotto, HTL, and the Embedded Machine, and more recently co-designed high-performance, multicore-scalable concurrent data structures and memory management systems. He co-founded the International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT) in 2001 and served as ACM SIGBED chair from 2011 until 2013. He has been IEEE TCAD and ACM TODAES associate editor, and is ACM Distinguished Speaker since 2017.

#### Related Titles

We relate our book to five others of which the first four are closely related while the last book (The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth) is mentioned because of its importance in the field. It can probably be found on virtually any computer scientist's book shelf.

The first three books essentially share with our book the broad target audience beyond computer science students while the fourth book (An Introduction to Computer Science: A Textbook for Beginners in Informatics by Gilbert Brands) targets, unlike us, undergraduate computer students specifically.

An interesting observation is that the titles of the first four books are perfect summaries of how our book is different. The first book (Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold) has a strong focus on code. The second book (But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone by J. Clark Scott) explains how computers work while the third book (The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken) explains how to build one. The fourth book (An Introduction to Computer Science: A Textbook for Beginners in Informatics by Gilbert Brands) is a traditional textbook for computer science students.

Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold

The book provides, similar to us, an introduction to computer science for broader audiences beyond computer science students and is therefore closely related to ours. The structure of the book is also somewhat similar to ours. The presentation and concept of the book are nevertheless quite different. There is a strong focus on what code is in many different forms in the first half of the book followed by a machine model and higher level concepts such as programs and operating systems in the second half of the book. This is quite different from our focus on the basic principles of computer science in general and our approach of integration through the selfie system in particular.

But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone by J. Clark Scott

The book provides, again similar to us, an introduction to computer science for broader audiences beyond computer science students and is therefore closely related to ours. The structure of the book is also somewhat similar to ours. The presentation and concept of the book are nevertheless again quite different. There is a strong focus on how a computer works in the first three quarters of the book followed by a much shorter treatment of higher level concepts such as programs and operating systems in the last quarter of the book. This is again quite different from our focus on elementary computer science with our use of self-referentiality as integrating concept.

The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken

The book provides, again similar to us, an introduction to computer science for broader audiences beyond computer science students and is therefore also closely related to ours. The structure of the book is also somewhat similar to ours. The presentation and concept of the book are nevertheless also quite different. The idea is to show how a computer is essentially built from scratch including the software stack running on top of the machine. This is obviously again quite different from our focus on elementary computer science with our use of self-referentiality as integrating concept.

An Introduction to Computer Science: A Textbook for Beginners in Informatics by Gilbert Brands

This book provides an introduction to computer science for undergraduate students. The structure of the book is similar to ours except for additional material on networking. The presentation is nevertheless also quite different. The book targets students specifically studying computer science rather than broader audiences like us. The content of the book is therefore purely technical without setting the material into context for readers that do not intend to study computer science. The concept of the book is in that sense a classical introduction to computer science similar to many introductory classes in the field.

The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth

This book is seminal work in multiple volumes that provides comprehensive coverage of many aspects of computer science. Structure, presentation, content, and target audience of the book are very different from ours. The book is the de-facto standard encyclopedia of computer science for readers that already have formal training in computer science.

#### Audience

Readers should have a background at the level of upper secondary school or above. The prerequisites for following the material presented here are an understanding of elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers), elementary geometry (one- and two-dimensional shapes), and elementary algebra (variables, equations). The prerequisites are anyway revisited in the book.

On a more personal note, I understand that there is a difference in intellectual development between readers 14 to 18 years old and adults, and that it is difficult to target both. I nevertheless believe the material is still accessible to some teenagers with at least some casual interest in computer science, and it would be ill-advised to exclude them. After all the book is also an attempt to establish computer science as an elementary subject for all. I specifically use more casual language, and try to avoid academic lingua as much as possible, to keep the younger portion of the target audience motivated when going through some more technical material and, simultaneously, make it more fun for everyone else. However, I only have experience teaching students around 18 to 19 years old and above, and I am glad to consider any feedback on this issue from people with more experience teaching teenagers.

#### Status of the Book

The introduction and the first chapter on encoding information in bits are complete. There is a preliminary outline of the remaining four chapters.

We expect to finish the manuscript within around one year by Spring 2021. The author is on sabbatical from July 2020 until February 2021 which should make that timeline feasible.

The current word count is at around 18,000 words. We plan the length of the book to be around 100,000 words.

On average there will be one figure, table, or non-textual example per section. For example, there are 16 sections in the first chapter on information with 9 figures, 1 table, and 6 non-textual examples.
