#### Brief Description:

This is a proposal for a book on *elementary computer science* for broad audiences with a background at the level of upper secondary school or above. The idea is to explain the absolute basics of computer science with a strong focus on *intuition* rather than formalism. The book explains, similar to related books, how a computer works in principle and how to do some basic programming, but goes beyond that by exploring the general *nature* of information and computing in the context of virtually everyone's reality of ubiquitous use of digital devices. This is also different from teaching computational thinking with its focus on problem solving.

Similar to elementary arithmetic with its five categories (numbers, measurement, geometry, algebra, and probabilities), we present five categories of elementary computer science in five chapters called information, machine, programming, tools, and computing. Information is on encoding and decoding information in bits. Machine is on a simple yet representative and still realistic machine model. Programming is on fundamental programming language concepts and basic algorithms. Tools is on translation and interpretation of programs with a focus on the semantics of programs. Computing is on virtualizing computation for enabling computing as utility and cloud computing. However, unlike traditional textbooks on elementary arithmetic, we use simple examples rather than formulae whenever possible.

A common theme of our book is an important concept in computer science called self-referentiality which has immediate counterparts in the real world. Think of an English dictionary written in English. The same can be done with software that defines its own meaning or even constructs a virtual machine for running software everywhere including itself. Seeing what self-referentiality is and how it is resolved is key to understanding elementary computer science. Teaching self-referentiality in its various forms is inspired by a software system called selfie that we developed over many years teaching undergraduate computer science students. Selfie is the source of many examples we use in the book and enables us to integrate our five categories of elementary computer science in one system. Due to its technical nature we nevertheless do not explain selfie in detail which is outside the scope of this book.
