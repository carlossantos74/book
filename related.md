The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken

The book provides, like us, an introduction to computer science for broader audiences beyond computer science students and is therefore closely related to ours. The structure of the book is also somewhat similar to ours. The presentation and concept of the book are nevertheless quite different. The idea is to show how a computer is essentially built from scratch including the software stack running on top of the machine. The idea of our book is to explain the absolute basics of computer science, not to build a computer and its software, but to enable our readers appreciate computer science in the context of their every day interests. This is also different from teaching computational thinking with its focus on problem solving. Our focus is on creating a deep yet intuitive understanding of what a computer and its software is by showing how simple rather than technical the basics of computer science really are.

An Introduction to Computer Science: A Textbook for Beginners in Informatics by Gilbert Brands

This book provides an introduction to computer science for undergraduate students. The structure of the book is similar to ours except for additional material on networking. The presentation is nevertheless quite different. The book targets students specifically studying computer science rather than broader audiences like us. The content of the book is therefore purely technical without setting the material into context for readers that do not intend to study computer science. The concept of the book is in that sense a classical introduction to computer science similar to many introductory classes in the field.

The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth

This book is seminal work in multiple volumes that provides comprehensive coverage of many aspects of computer science. Structure, presentation, content, and target audience of the book are very different from ours. The book is the de-facto standard encyclopedia of computer science for readers that already have formal training in computer science.
