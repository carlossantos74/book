# Computer Science for All

### by Christoph Kirsch

#### Acknowledgements

This book is the result of many years of teaching and working with students and colleagues around the world. I am grateful to my group of students and faculty in Salzburg who, over the years, helped me with refining and deepening my understanding of computer science. I am also particularly grateful to my colleague Professor Raja Sengupta at UC Berkeley who challenged me to the point that made me discover what has now become the Selfie Project and is the foundation of this book. The design of the Selfie compiler is inspired by the Oberon compiler of Professor Niklaus Wirth from ETH Zurich. The design of the Selfie microkernel is inspired by microkernels of Professor Jochen Liedtke from University of Karlsruhe.
